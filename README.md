# WebGL-Solar-System

## Running application
Due to how this app handles and renderers textures, it is has to run on a server instance. There are many ways to do this.

Here are some examples to get it running:

1. Python http server (if you have python 3 installed)
    1. Open command prompt
    1. Type: python -m http.server
        * To end server: Ctrl + C
    1. In Web Browser navigate: 127.0.0.1:8000/
    1. Navigate to WebGL-Solar-System/proj3/solar_system.html
1. Or if you have VS Code then you could just get the Live Server extension and run it there.
1. Or visit my online portfolio for a live demo -> https://kb-42.github.io/#first
